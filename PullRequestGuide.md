How to Contribute
=================

We welcome any pull requests, and will review them and merge them at our discresion.  Here are some points to consider:

* We prefer a hundred pull requests over time, rather than a thousand-file pull request all at once.  Make your pull requests small and focused.  We will review every change you make, and will deny pull requests that make this task inconvinient.
* Try to follow our coding standards.  You should become well-acquianted with our code if you intend to contribute.
* If you add features, try to make them smaller features, and avoid doing features listed in our [Milestones](https://github.com/LibMinecraft/LibMinecraft/issues/milestones).  Odds are that we already have a first party team member working on those.

The team spends a lot of time fixing bugs and documenting, especially the latter.  We've spent a huge number of hours on documentation alone.  If you plan to contribute, your efforts are best served documenting our code with XML documentation, or fixing some bugs.  If you choose to fix a bug, make an issue in our [issue tracker](https://github.com/LibMinecraft/LibMinecraft/issues) for it.  Of course, you don't have to fix our bugs or document our code, you can do whatever you see fit - though it is probably a good idea to make an issue for it before you start so we know what you're up to, and so we don't do it ourselves.

Thanks for your interest in helping us out!
