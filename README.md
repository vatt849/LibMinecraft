LibMinecraft
============

LibMinecraft is a .NET library for Minecraft clients and servers, compatible with the Minecraft 1.2.3 protocol.

Using LibMinecraft is easy - here's an example of connecting to a server:

    MulitplayerClient client = new MultiplayerClient();
    MinecraftServer server = new MinecraftServer("127.0.0.1");
    User user = new User("username", "password");

    client.Connect(server);
    client.LogIn(user); // Now you're playing on the server!

But perhaps you want to run a server instead?

    MinecraftServer server = new MinecraftServer();
    MultiplayerServer service = new MultiplayerServer(server);

    service.AddWorld(new World());
    service.Start(); // Players can now connect to your server!
